=====================

This library provides very simple bindings for FMOD Ex for the BennuGD
media programming language.

The source code for the binding itself is licensed under the terms of the
MIT/X11 license (see COPYING for details) but FMOD Ex used a proprietary
license and is not free to use unless you're using FMOD Ex for a free,
non-commercial use. Please, see http://www.fmod.org/index.php/sales for
their licensing terms.

If you pay them, however, you're free to use this binding.
