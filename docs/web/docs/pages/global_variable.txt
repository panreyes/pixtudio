A global variable is a [variable](variable "wikilink") that is
accessible from anywhere in the code; it is shared by the whole code.

There's also a number of [predefined](predefined "wikilink") [local
variables](local_variables "wikilink").

To start the declaration of global variables, use
[Global](Global "wikilink").
