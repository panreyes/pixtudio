A constant is a container containing a [value](value "wikilink"). This
value cannot be changed apart from initialization, hence the name
constant, as opposed to a [variable](variable "wikilink") of which the
value can vary. A constant can be of any [datatype](datatype "wikilink")
and can contain a value according to its datatype. For example, an
integer has whole numbers between -2\^31 (-2147483648) and +2\^31-1
(2147483647) (e.g. 23) , a float has a floating point number (e.g.
2.674) and a string has a series of characters (e.g. "Hello World!").

There is a number of [predefined
constants](predefined_constants "wikilink"). These variables are
predefined, which means they exist without the programmer making them.
They can be useful in a some [functions](functions "wikilink") or when
assigning them to some [global variables](global_variable "wikilink").
