BennuGD, a fork from Fenix 0.93, is an interpreted programming language aimed at making games. It is designed in such a way, the graphical, sound and threading systems are easier to use, which makes Bennu a powerful language, not only for beginners, but also for experienced programmers.

The BennuGD core is completely portable, it can be compiled for any platform, given there is a C compiler for it. The core contains the compiler, interpreter and runtime library. Bennu Modules use SDL for many of the basic functionality. Because of this, even the BennuGD modules are portable to many operating systems: Windows, Linux, GP2X Wiz, BeOS/Haiku, MacOS X, even consoles and handhelds like Dreamcast, GP2x or Wii. This makes it much fun to code in Bennu: your games can be played on your console, without modification!
