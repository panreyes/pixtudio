PixTudio is an Open Source 2D game engine and scripting language that originated as a fork of [BennuGD](http://www.bennugd.org). The project puts an emphasis on mobile gaming but it perfectly suitable for 2D game creation for the desktop, too.
The scripting language is easy to understand and makes use of co-routines, called [processes](#process).

The game engine is, also, highly portable and should compile directly in Windows, Linux, OS X, Android & iOS but past versions of the code where compiled for multiple console systems (including Nintendo's Wii). It should also work with varying grades of effort in other Unices, Haiku or even newer console systems, given that an SDL2 port exists for the platform in question.
