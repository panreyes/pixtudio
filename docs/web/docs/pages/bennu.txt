Introduction
------------

BennuGD, a [Fenix](Fenix "wikilink") fork from Fenix
[0.93](0.93 "wikilink"), is an interpreted programming language aimed at
making games. It is designed in such a way, the graphical, sound and
threading systems are easier to use, which makes Bennu a powerful
language, not only for beginners, but also for experienced programmers.

The BennuGD core is completely portable, it can be compiled for any
platform, given there is a C compiler for it. The core contains the
compiler, interpreter and runtime library. Bennu Modules use SDL for
many of the basic functionality. Because of this, even the BennuGD
modules are portable to many operating systems: Windows, Linux, GP2X
Wiz, BeOS/Haiku, MacOS X, even consoles and handhelds like Dreamcast,
GP2x or Wii. This makes it much fun to code in Bennu: your games can be
played on your console, without modification!
