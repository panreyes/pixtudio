**VOID**

[Bennu](Bennu "wikilink") doesn't have **void**s as such. But when we
look at for example the [function](function "wikilink")
[free](free "wikilink")(), we see that you can pass it a **void
pointer**. This means, that you can pass it a pointer of whatever type
you want; an **int pointer**, **word pointer** or even a **pointer
pointer**. So in this case, **void** means "undefined".

There is another case in which **void**s can occur. This is when a
function returns nothing, but this never happens in Bennu.
