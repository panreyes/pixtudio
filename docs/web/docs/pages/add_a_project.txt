[**Projects**](projects "wikilink")

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to add
----------

To add a project to the list, simply create a page in the `Project`
namespace (create an article with name: `Project:<projectname>`) and add
it to the category `Projects`. That's all the work to add a project, but
if you should want multiple pages, it might be a good idea to add all
pages created for this project to the categories `Projects` and
`Project<projectname>` by putting the following lines in the article:

    [[Category:Projects]]
    [[Category:Project<projectname>]]

Also it is advised to use [this template](Template:Project "wikilink")
for quick info about your project.

What to add
-----------

All sorts of projects are welcome, from a simple space invaders to a
full blown MMORPG. Other kinds are also welcome, like DLL's or other
secondary system projects.
