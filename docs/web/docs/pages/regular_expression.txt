Regular expressions can be used for a lot of text processing things,
like finding matches, replacing texts, splitting and joining strings.
The syntax is quite complex, but it packs a lot of sophistication in
just 4 functions.

Bennu has 4 functions anvailible: [Split](Split "wikilink")(),
[Join](Join "wikilink")(), [Regex](Regex "wikilink")() and
[Regex\_replace](Regex_replace "wikilink")(). They are very usefull in
combination with the file and string functions, such as
[glob](glob "wikilink")(), [fgets](fgets "wikilink")(),
[fputs](fputs "wikilink")(), [find](find "wikilink")() and
[Len](Len "wikilink")(). With some creativity you can create text based
spreadsheet formats or search and replace texts.
