**INT** sound\_channels = 8

**Sound\_channels** is a [global variable](global_variable "wikilink"),
holding the number of sound channels, which is set when sound is used
for the first time, meaning altering the value of this variable will
have no effect after sound has been initialized. This number can range
from 1 to 32 and the default is 8.
