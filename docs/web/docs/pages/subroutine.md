A subroutine is a program segment that can be
called and used by any other bit of the
program. So basically, if there's something that you want to do quite a
lot in your program, then you can write a subroutine for it and then
just call this subroutine every time you want to to that.

In PixTudio this is achieved by the use of
[functions](#function) and [processes](#process)
