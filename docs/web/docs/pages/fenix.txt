Fenix is an SDL-based virtual machine, based on the language and
behaviour of [DIV Games Studio](DIV "wikilink"), an obsolete DOS-based
game creation suite. It is specially designed for programming games,
much like DIV was, though unlike DIV, it can easily be used for any
purpose.

Because Fenix is an SDL-based virtual machine, its portability is high
and as such it runs on many platforms, including Microsoft Windows,
Linux, BeOS, MacOS, GP32 (and GP2X), Sega Dreamcast, BSD.

Fenix hasn't advanced for some years, but fortunately there is a Fenix
0.93 fork called [Bennu](Bennu "wikilink"). This fork has everything the
latest Fenix has, but is actually still active. Development continues
and numerous fixes and features have been done. If you are using Fenix,
you would probably be better of using Bennu.

Latest version
--------------

The latest official version is [0.92a](0.92a "wikilink") and the latest
unofficial version is [0.93 Preview 9](0.93 "wikilink").
