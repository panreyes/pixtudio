A variable is a container containing a [value](value "wikilink"). This
value can vary, hence the name variable, as opposed to a
[constant](constant "wikilink") of which the value cannot be changed. A
variable can be of any [datatype](datatype "wikilink") and can contain a
value according to its datatype. For example, an integer has whole
numbers between -2\^31 and +2\^31-1 (e.g. 23) , a float has a floating
point number (e.g. 2.674) and a string has a series of characters (e.g.
"Hello World!").

There is a number of [predefined
variables](predefined_variables "wikilink"), like [local
variables](local_variable "wikilink") and [global
variables](global_variable "wikilink"). These variables are predefined,
which means they exist without the programmer making them. They can
contain useful information or perform an action when changed.

A [function](function "wikilink") or [process](process "wikilink") can
accept values when called. The value it's called with is called an
[argument](argument "wikilink") and the variable or value inside the
function or process is called a [parameter](parameter "wikilink").
