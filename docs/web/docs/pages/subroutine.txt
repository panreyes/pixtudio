A subroutine is a program segment that can be
[called](function_call "wikilink") and used by any other bit of the
program. So basically, if there's something that you want to to quite a
lot in your program, then you can write a subroutine for it and then
just call this subroutine every time you want to to that. In
[Bennu](Bennu "wikilink") this is achieved by the use of
[functions](function "wikilink") and [processes](process "wikilink")
