[Bennu](Bennu "wikilink") [bitmap](bitmap "wikilink") file. A MAP file
contains a simple and rectangular graphic of 1, 8, 16 or 32bpp. These
files can be loaded and generated by using
[load\_map](load_map "wikilink") and [save\_map](save_map "wikilink")
functions respectively.

The main advantage of using MAP files instead of regular
[PNG](PNG "wikilink") files (or other more extended formats) is that the
former stores not only bitmap data but also other information, e.g.
[Control Points](Control_Point "wikilink") data, which may be useful
when programming with [Bennu](Bennu "wikilink"). Its main disadvantage
is not being supported by conventional graphic editing programs.

Some [IDEs](IDE "wikilink") and other third-party tools give support to
the MAP format and allow you to convert within this and other formats.
