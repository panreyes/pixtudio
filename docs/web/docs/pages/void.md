**VOID**

[PixTudio](#pixtudio) doesn't have `void`s as such. But when we
look at for example the [function](#function)
[free](#free)(), we see that you can pass it a **void
pointer**. This means, that you can pass it a pointer of whatever type
you want; an **int pointer**, **word pointer** or even a **pointer
pointer**. So in this case, **void** means "any".
