**FLOAT**

**Float**s are floating point numbers ranging from about -10^38.53 to
about 10^38.53. This is achieved by dividing 32 bits (4 bytes) in a
certain way, with a certain precision. A float is used for operations in
which both very large and small numbers are used, while rounding is not
permitted. Unlike [ints](#int) or [shorts](#short),
a **float** actually has decimal digits. Their accuracy is about 7
decimal digits.
