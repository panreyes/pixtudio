[[Category:blendops]]

== Description ==
A blend operation is the act of executing the blending of a [[graphic]] (source) with the pixels the graphic is drawn on (target) using a [[blend table]].

This is done in two ways:
* The blendop is performed explicitly using [[blendop_apply]](), modifying the graphic.
* The blendop is [[blendop_assign|assigned]] to a [[graphic]] and performed implicitly when that graphic is drawn. This method is not available for modes lower than 16bit.

Blendops are not supported in 32bit mode.
