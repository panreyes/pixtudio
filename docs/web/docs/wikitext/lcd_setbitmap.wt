==Definition==
'''INT''' LCD_SetBitmap ( <'''INT''' device> , <'''INT''' priority> , <'''BYTE POINTER''' map> )

Sets the bitmap of the device to a certain map with a certain priority.

== Parameters ==
{|
| '''INT''' device || - Number of the device.
|-
| '''INT''' priority || - The priority of the bitmap (see [[#Notes|notes]]).
|-
| '''BYTE POINTER''' map || - Pointer to a 160x43 byte array.
|}

== Returns ==
'''INT''' : [[LCD_ERRORCODES|LCD.DLL Errorcodes]]
{|
| LCD_ERROR_NONE || - 0 || - No error.
|-
| LCD_ERROR_SERVICEINACTIVE || - -14 || - The service is inactive.
|-
| LCD_ERROR_DEVICENOTCONNECTED || - -21 || - Device not connected.
|-
| LCD_ERROR_INVALIDPARAMETER || - -22 || - Invalid parameter.

== Notes ==
* Multiple priorities can be used:
{|
| LCD_PRIORITY_IDLE_NO_SHOW || - Lowest priority, disable displaying. Use this priority when you donâ€™t have anything to show.
|-
| LCD_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND || - Priority used for low priority items.
|-
| LCD_PRIORITY_NORMAL || - Normal priority, to be used by most applications most of the time.
|-
| LCD_PRIORITY_ALERT || - Highest priority. To be used only for critical screens, such as "your CPU temperature is too high"
|}

* One can use [[map_buffer]]() to obtain a byte pointer to a map. Make sure this map is of size 160x43 and it has a color depth of 8.
