== Definition ==

A ProcessTypeID is a unique identification code, for a [[processType]]. A ProcessTypeID is smaller than 65536 (2^16).

== Example ==
Kill all SpaceShip()s (see [[process]]):
<pre>
Begin
    signal(type SpaceShip,s_kill);
End
</pre>
[[signal]]() signals all [[process|processes]] of [[processType]] SpaceShip the [[signals|signal]] to [[die]]. This is done by using the [[constant]] [[s_kill]] as the signal.
