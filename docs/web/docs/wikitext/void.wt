'''VOID'''

[[Bennu]] doesn't have '''void'''s as such. But when we look at for example the [[function]] [[free]](), we see that you can pass it a '''void pointer'''. This means, that you can pass it a pointer of whatever type you want; an '''int pointer''', '''word pointer''' or even a '''pointer pointer'''. So in this case, '''void''' means "undefined".

There is another case in which '''void'''s can occur. This is when a function returns nothing, but this never happens in Bennu.
