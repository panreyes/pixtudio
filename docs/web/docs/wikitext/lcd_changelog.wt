[[Lcddll|'''Up to LCD.DLL''']]
----


Changelog of [[LCD_DLL|LCD.DLL]].

v1.11:
    Yeah, code is a bit messy, but it seems to work anyway.

v0.03:
    Recoded so it's easier in use. Not backwards compatible because previous versions
        have been used by only a few people. See [[LCD.DLL|main page]].

v0.01, v0.02:
    Created main functions and so on.
