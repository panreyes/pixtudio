== Definition ==
A drawing is something drawn on the screen using [[Functioncategory:drawing|draw_xxx() functions]]. This can be a circle, square, line or whatever they can draw. A drawing is associated with a certain [[DrawID]], returned by the function which drew the drawing.

A drawing also has a certain z value, initialized when drawn and at that point equal to the value set using [[drawing_z]](). The drawing will behave like a [[process]] with the same [[z]]. When [[drawing_map]]() is used, that z value is ignored and the drawing is just drawn on the specified [[graphic]].
