==Definition==
'''INT''' pcx_load ( <'''STRING''' filename>, [ <'''POINTER''' id>] )

Creates a new [[graphic]], using the specified [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCX pcx] file as contents and puts it in the [[system file]]. Returns the [[graphID]] of the created graphic. The [[color depth]] of the created graphic will be the same as the loaded pcx file.

The previous name [[load_pcx]]() is deprecated. 

== Parameters ==
{| 
| '''STRING''' filename || - The name of the pcx file to be loaded, including a possible [[path]].
|-
|'''POINTER''' id || - Optional parameter, for loading a map in the background.
|}

== Returns ==

'''INT''' : [[graphID]]
{|
| -2 || - Waiting for the file to be loaded, see notes.
|-
| -1 || - There was an error loading the file.
|-
| >=0 || - The graphID of the newly created graphic.
|}


''the following applies for versions prior rc282:''

'''INT''' : [[graphID]]
{|
| 0 || - There was an error loading the file.
|-
| >0 || - The graphID of the newly created graphic.
|}

== Notes ==

The optional parameter '''id''' was introduced in version rc282 and allows you to load resources in the background.
It used with the [[Offset]] operator. See example below:

<pre>
      load_pcx("archivo_gordo.pcx", &idpcx);
      while(idpcx==-2)
            say("Big File Loading ....");
            frame;
      end
      if(idpcx==-1)
          say("Something went wrong!!");
          exit(); // o return
      end

      say("Big file loaded ok!!");
</pre>
