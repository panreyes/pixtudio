== Description ==
A file is a container for [[graphic]]s, identified by a non-negative [[int]]eger (0 or higher). It holds all information about the contained graphics ([[pixel]]s, [[width]], [[height]], [[depth]], name, etc). Each of these graphics have a unique identifier inside the file (positive [[int]]).

A file can be created for example by loading an [[FPG]] (''Fichero Para Gr√°ficos'', meaning "file for graphics") into it, by using [[fpg_load]](), which creates a new file with the graphics from the loaded FPG and returns a unique identifier.
Another option is to create a new, empty one by using [[fpg_new]](). Don't let the name ''fpg''_new() fool you: fpg_new() has nothing to do with the filetype FPG. This is because the FPG format is only for files and not for internal use. There are more ways to load graphics into a file.

A file can be used by using the [[local variable]] [[Local:File|file]] or by using the identifier in the various [[functions]] with a file parameter.

Don't forget to unload it with [[fpg_unload]]() after use.

== Example ==
<pre>
import "mod_map"
import "mod_grproc"
import "mod_key"
import "mod_wm"

Global
    int file_id;
    int file_id2;
End

Process Main()
Begin

    // Load FPG
    file_id = load_fpg("example.fpg");
    file_id2 = load_fpg("example2.fpg");

    // Set locals for display of graph
    file = file_id;
    graph = 1;
    x = y = 50;
    
    // assign Ship to use example2.fpg
    Ship(300,100,5,file_id2,1); // undefined in this sample
    
    Repeat
        frame;
    Until(key(_ESC)||exit_status)

End
</pre>
Used in example: [[load_fpg]](), [[key]](), [[x]], [[y]], [[file]], [[graph]]. [[process]]

Media in example: [[Media:example.fpg|example.fpg]]

Note: nothing will be seen unless you have an [[FPG]] "example.fpg" with a [[graphic]] with ID 1.
